\section{Utilization of My Research}{}
\begin{itemize}[]
    \item During my postdoc, I developed the required numerical methods to study transients in hydraulic turbines and published the framework as an open-source package (\href{https://github.com/salehisaeed/semiImplicitSlip}{\texttt{semiImplicitSlip}}). The Research and Development department of Vattenfall, a leading energy production company in Europe, is now using my development to study the transient operation of their hydropower systems.

    \item I also have other open-source GitHub projects aimed at making my research beneficial for both the academic and industrial communities. For more information, please refer to my GitHub at \href{https://github.com/salehisaeed}{github.com/salehisaeed}.
