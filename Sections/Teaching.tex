\section{Pedagogical courses}{}

In October 2023, I was awarded the ``Diploma in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education" in recognition of the successful fulfillment of all program requirements, including seven courses. The Diploma is designed to meet the learning outcomes defined by the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions (SUHF). The program is equivalent to 15 ECTS credits or 10 weeks of full-time study. It concludes with conducting a final pedagogical project related to the teaching activities. More information about my final project is provided in my pedagogical portfolio.

Additionally, to further refine my abilities in the realm of supervision, I completed the ``Supervising Research Students" course (3.0 ECTS) which is not included in the teaching diploma program. The following table presents a summary of my pedagogical training.

My teaching diploma and certificate of completed courses are provided in Appendices~\ref{sec:TeachingDiploma} and Appendix~\ref{sec:Transcript}. For more details, please see my pedagogical portfolio.
