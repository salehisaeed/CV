    \textbf{Postdoc} & Chalmers University of Technology \\
    2019 -- 2023 & Project: New operating procedures of hydropower for a sustainable energy system
    During my postdoctoral position, my research focused on developing advanced numerical methods in OpenFOAM to simulate the transient operations of hydraulic turbines. I also expanded my expertise in data-driven and machine-learning approaches, particularly in the field of reduced-order modeling, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).    
    The research resulted in several publications in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals and an open-source software package for simulating hydraulic turbine transients, which is being utilized by Vattenfall, a leading energy company in Sweden.
